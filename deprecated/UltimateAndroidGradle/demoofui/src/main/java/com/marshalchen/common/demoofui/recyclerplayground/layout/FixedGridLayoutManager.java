/**
 * A {@link android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.LayoutManager} implementation
 * that places children in a two-dimensional grid, sized to a fixed column count
 * value. User scrolling is possible in both horizontal and vertical directions
 * to view the data set.
 *
 * <p>The column count is controllable via {@link #setTotalColumnCount(int)}. The layout manager
 * will generate the number of rows necessary to accommodate the data set based on
 * the fixed column count.
 *
 * <p>This manager does make some assumptions to simplify the implementation:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>All child views are assumed to be the same size</li>
 *     <li>The window of visible views is a constant</li>
